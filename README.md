# i3-config Philosophy

I like including three-letter commands for some common stuff including connecting a wiimote for emulation, and an explicit link to some other files like my dotfiles from the command line. "Syu" updates/upgrades/autocleans for apt, which I got from my time with Arch :).

I remapped the `JKL;` to `HJKL` for moving around windows because the almost-vim-but-off-by-one default is bananas.

`S` and `s` are symbol pickers. `QWERT` are reserved for high-level stuff

`v` is "vertical" splitting. `shift+v` is for "horizontal".

`C` ("Calculate") launches my preferred calculator, octave. `c` ("computer") launches virtualbox (i.e. other OSes)

`M` is for "Mozilla"

`g` is for `geary`.  Shift+`G` is for slack (I know.. I know... Proprietary Crap. I'm moving away from it along with Virtualbox VMs and Dropbox, but I collaborate with too many people on these tools that are too resistant to change).

`t` doesn't quite work right for reasons I don't understand.
