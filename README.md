# i3-config Philosophy

I like including three-letter commands for some common stuff including connecting a wiimote for emulation, and an explicit link to some other files like my dotfiles from the command line.

I remapped the `JKL;` to `HJKL` for moving around windows because the almost-vim-but-off-by-one default is not good.

`S` and `s` are symbol pickers. `QWERT` are reserved for high-level stuff

`v` is "vertical" splitting. `shift+v` is for "horizontal".

`c` ("computer") launches virtualbox (i.e. other OSes)

`M` is for "Mozilla"

'g' was for geary, but I use mailspring for better or worse, 'G' is for 'gedit'



Good Luck!
